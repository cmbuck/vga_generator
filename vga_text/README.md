# VGA Text

This project builds upon work in the VGA Background project and does the following:

* Generates horizontal and vertical synchronization signals for a 640x480 VGA display
* Defines a 8x16 font ROM for ASCII characters 0 to 127
* Defines a buffer of 7-bit values use to represent the 80x30 characters on the screen
* Currently, all text is green, but any of the 8 available colors could be used.
